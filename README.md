# Introduction to [Rojo](https://rojo.space/)

## What is Rojo?
Rojo is a tool that allows you to move lua files from your system into your Roblox game (mainly used for scripting).

## Okay.. but why should I use it?
With the power described above, you can:
- code with editors outside of roblox (Visual Studio Code, Atom, ...)
- this also means you can code offline - something you can't on roblox studio!
- what this also means is that a crash won't make you lose your work because a code editor can hardly crash
- have version control in your game (using git and uploading your game on github)
- since you have access to version control, it's super easy to work with a group of developers
- use tools that aren't available on roblox

## Is Rojo trustworthy?
**Yes.** Examples of games that use it include Adopt Me, Funky Friday, Tower Defense Simulator and Jailbreak. (<https://rojo.space/>)

## How do I use it?
I think telling you everything here would be a bit too long, so here's some links that personally helped me.

## How do I port an existing game to the file system?
This page should tell you exactly how to achieve that.

## I don't have the roblox IntelliSense anymore!
Check this plugin out - made exactly for that reason.

## Final words
Rojo is used and trusted by many famous developers out there. It's something that definitely won't harm to at least try out.
**Remember: If you dislike rojo, the switch back is as easy as editing your roblox place directly instead of the files on the filesystem!**
